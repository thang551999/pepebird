        Blue Bird Pepe (BBPEPE) is an independent token that is not affiliated with any group, individual, or
        organization. It was designed purely to provide enjoyment for the community and should be approached as such.

        <br />
        $BBPEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or
        roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.
